JARS is a food and water tracker designed to help people be more informed about their health goals. JARS easily lets users create an account and begin tracking their food and water consumption. Users can see how much water and how many calories they have left to eat/drink that day. JARS also provides a weekly calendar for both food and water tracking. This allows the user to see their consumption trends throughout the week to make sure each day they are staying on track for their goals.

This software is developed with college students in mind, who often don't think much about their health. With this tracker, college students will be able to see their habits and begin working to improve on them.
